Titanic: Survival Probability Guessing (TSPG) Game
==================================================

Titanic sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, after hitting an iceberg. 
Unfortunaely, Titanic did not have enough life boats to save all the people on board. Hence many individuals perished in this disaster. Many factors such as - social status (class), sex, age etc., decided the loading of the lifeboats and in-turn decided the
probability of surival for a person. Being a passenger or a crew member, also 
affected the chances of survival. 

TSPG Game is based on the probability of survival of a passenger on Titanic. 
To play, simply select a value of probability from the drop-down taking into 
consideration the Passenger Details displayed. 

How does TSPG game work?

* TSPG game challenges you to guess the probability of survival for a passenger 
using the passenger details displayed on the screen. The passenger details 
include - Class (1 indicates first or upper class, 2 - middle/standard class and 3 - lower class), Age and Sex. This App has a built-in prediction model to 
calculate the survival probabilty. It compares its model-based-predition to your 
guess and displays the Result. 

* TSPG App also displays facts about Titanic disaster and surviors under the 
title - 'Did you know that:'. These facts could be used to improve your guessing. 

* TSPG App also has a running counter which displays consecutive correct 
guesses made by a player.
